# Primes
This is a project that I have been working on with a friend of mine for a few months.
We make programs to find and store prime numbers for later processing.

As of when this README was written, no specific processing will be aplied and it is just running for fun.
Hopefully you might be able to learn something from it.

If you have any suggestions or ideas for the project, feel free to let us know!
